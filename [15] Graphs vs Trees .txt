GRAPH and Tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- A cycle is going to the same node without crossing the same edge
- Every tree is a graph but nor every graph is a tree

- A tree is an acyclic (No cycle) and connected graph
  A tree cannot contain a cycle and a tree has to be connected (No stranded nodes)
  A single node is considered a tree and even an empty graph is a tree
  A tree is a connected graph

- BFS and DFS is O(V^2)

Binary Tree: 
~~~~~~~~~~~
- Binary tree has restrictions of a tree plus the restrictions of the binary tree. Binary Tree is a more constricted Tree

- The Root has a right child and a left child
A leaf is a node with zero children. Everything else is called internal nodes

Binary Search Tree
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- All nodes in the right subtree are bigger than or equal to the parent node.
- All the nodes in the left subtree are smaller than the parent node
These conditions can be changed according to how we choose to use them. But this way, and using inOrder() will give us a sorted result.

- Search, Add, and Delete re the 3 main functions in the Binry Search Tree
- adding and searching is O(n) worst case is traversing the biggest subtree
- sqewed tree is the worst case: when we have majority of the children on one side

Tree Traversals:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Inorder - preOrder - postOrder
