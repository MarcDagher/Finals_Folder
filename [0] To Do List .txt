# Graphs and Trees -> difference between them

Algorithms:
~~~~~~~~~~
[DONE] # Review Linear and Binary Search 
[DONE] # Review Sequential and Merge Sort
[DONE] # Review Linked Lists and Doubly Linked Lists
[DONE] # Uses Stacks and Queues with Linked Lists
# Use adjacency Lists and Adjacency Matrix with Linked Lists
# DFS and BFS using Linked Lists and watch out for "professional terms" -> push-pop-enqueue-dequeue
# Binary tree and Binary search Tree
# Tree Traversal -> inOrder() preOrder() postOrder()

ONCE THIS IS DONE -> WE COVERED EVERYTHON WE TOOK
